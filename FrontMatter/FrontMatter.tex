\begin{abstract}   

An abstract should contain a motivation (1) of your research and some information of the background.
This should be followed by a clear statement of your aims (2).
Next you should discuss the methods (3) used to fulfil your aims.
Then state your results (4), followed by conclusions (5) and recommendations (6). 

Structured abstracts are great! 
As this is a big thesis, each of these 6 points should be a whole paragraph.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Impact Statement}
\vspace*{3cm}
\begin{impact}

An impact statement is required.
UCL's graduate school writes:

\begin{displayquote}[\cc{uclgraduateschool_impact_2018}]
The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis, discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use.
Consider benefits both inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.
The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods or methodology, the curriculum; they might be within your research area and potentially within other research areas.

The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.
The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities or organisations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of research, over many years, decades or longer.

Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policy makers and public 
service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics etc.
