# My UCL PhD Thesis Template
The style I used for my [PhD dissertation](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10072657/). Based primarily on [Louise Bowler's dissertation](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:a138d837-be95-487e-87e5-e1cf4769e9a4) at Oxford, which in turn is based on others. Extended and customised further with the invaluable help of the [tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com) community. 

## Todo:
 * specify license (CC NC?)
 * setup overleaf clone / template link
 * build server for dissertation template
  * build both revision and final
  * upload the resulting pdf's somewhere sensibly
  * have the github actions summary of warnings / failures easily accessible / required for merge?
